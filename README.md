## ✅ Covered Topics

### 🔹 Q1.1 – Reconstruct Value from Sum Array
- Retrieves a value from an original array using its cumulative (sum) array.
- **Time Complexity:** O(1)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### 🔹 Q1.2 – Binary Search Over Derived Array
- Efficiently finds the index of a value in the original array using only the sum array.
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### 🔹 Q2 – Subset-Sum on Super-Increasing Sequence
- Checks if a subset of a super-increasing series can sum to a target value.
- Uses a greedy algorithm tailored to the properties of super-increasing sequences.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
